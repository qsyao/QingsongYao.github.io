# About Me

- I am a final-year PhD student in the Institute of computing technology [(ICT)](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), Chinese academic of science (CAS), advised by [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html). 
- I obtained my B.E. in school of the gifted young ([SCGY](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), Â∞ëÂπ¥Áè≠Â≠¶Èô¢, honors college) from University of science and technology of China [(USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019. 
- I gained valuable internship experience in 2019 at Microsoft Research Asia [(MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) under the mentorship of [Jilong Xue](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jxue/). This was followed by internships at [Tencent Jarvis Lab](https://jarvislab.tencent.com/index-en.html) supervised by [Dr. Yefeng Zheng](https://sites.google.com/site/yefengzheng/), and at Z2sky.ai with [Prof. S. kevin zhou]((https://sz.ustc.edu.cn/en/en_research_show/42.html)) as my adviser.

My research lies at developing secure and label-efficient medical image analysis algorithms with AI to achieve cost-efficient-yet-reliable medical decision-making, with recent focus on 1) learning under severely scarce labeled data, e.g., one-shot medical landmark detction and segmentation. 2) learning without any labeled data, e.g., anomaly detection and zero-shot classification, 3) adversarial attack and defence on medical diagnosis network, 4) universal medical landmark detection & segmentation.
